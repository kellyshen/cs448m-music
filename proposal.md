# Making Music with Motors
### Kelly Shen

 **Project description / overall goal:**

I would like to create a multi-part music machine powered by motors/arduinos, and play original music / music covers with it. 

The main goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of how motors, arduinos, and all intermediate / related components work. Embarassingly, this is all quite new and foreign to me - the xy plotter project was pretty eye-opening and quite frankly I relied a lot on my teammates / blindly following the step-by-step instructions, without necessarily understanding why connecting certain pieces in certain ways produced the resulting functionalities. I want to now take the time to really understand the details of the whole process from sheet music / midi file --> .ino file --> how pins are activated on the arduino --> what signals are sent to the shield / drivers --> current flowing through the motors to make them turn, etc.

The secondary goal motivation for this project is a desire to play with music. I think it would be fun to take an arbitrary song I like, convert it to an Arduino sketch, then add additional melodic lines (or edit a song to produce a different vibe, or simply test out whatever whimsical idea crosses my mind). I also think it would be fun to add drums / a base line controlled by a servo motor that moves some attachment to contact a tin(?) can (similar idea to pen holders for the xy plotter). In addition, I wan to experiment with varying timbre based on surrounding / attached materials. I also think it would be interesting to experiment with using multiple arduinos and seeing if they would sync properly with each other. I think adding lines, figuring out a drum set up, finding setups that meaningfully change timbre, and syncing between the arduinos will all potentially provide unforseen challenges. 

 **Plan and milestones:** 

The general steps I plan to take - 
	
1. Gather all necessary materials
2. Get single melody to play end-to-end
3. Add additional motors / melodic lines (from existing sheet music)
4a. Add motor for drum set up 
4b. Experiment with proper materials of object being dropped / hit to produce drum sound
5. Edit / add original melodic lines
6. Cover / connect motors with various materials to test timbre effects
7. Incorporate a second arduino?
8. Repeat across different types of music to examine differences 

 **Parts and supplies needed:** 

*1-2 arduino unos
*1-2 stepper motor shields
*4-8 stepper motor drivers
*4-8 stepper motors 
*1-2 servo motors 
*can, paper, wood, metal, ?? 
*power supply
*power cord
*power zip cord(s)
*usb cord(s)

If I don't intend to keep the project, could I borrow the materials used in the xy plotters?
